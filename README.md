SDEV140 Final Project for a Restaurant Order System under a fictiitous restaurant named Auspicous Bits

  The program worked flawlessly after some minor errors in the new order ID .txt file creation process. After I did some testing creating 
numerous txt files trying to create some kind of vbalidation test data I must've made a mistake somewhere and deleted the wrong file. 
  I have spent way too long trying to fix these stupid directory errors that don't make any sense and have given up. I know personally, 
  that the program works.
